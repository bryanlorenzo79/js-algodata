    <h3>Algorithm analysis</h3>
    <p>
    There are multiple ways to solve a problem.<br>
    Ex: There are multiple algorithm to sort a list of numbers.<br>
    How do we analyse which one of them is the most effecient algorithm?<br>
    <br>
    The absolute running time of an algorithm cannot be predicted, since it <br>
    depends on a number of factors.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Programming language used to implement the algorithm.</li>
      <li>The computer the program runs on.</li>
      <li>Other programs running at the same time.</li>
      <li>Quality of the operating system.</li>
      </ul>
      We evaluate the performance of an algorithm <b>in terms of its input size.</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>Time complexity</b> - Amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size.<br>
      <b>Space complexity</b> - Amount of memory taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size.<br>
      <br>
      By evaluating against the input size, the analysis is not only machine independent<br>
      but the comparison is also more appropriate.<br><br>
      There is no one solution that works every single time. It is always good to know<br>
      multiple ways to solve a problem and use the best solution, given your constraints.<br><br>
      If your app needs to be very quick and has plenty of memory to work with, you dont<br>
      have to worry about space complexity.<br><br>
      If you have very little memory to work with, you should pick a solution that is<br>
      relatively slower but needs less space.<br><br>
      <h3>How to represent complexity?</h3>
      Asymtotic notations - mathematical tools to represent time and space complexity.<br>
      <ol>
        <li>Big-O Notation(O-notation) - worst case complexity</li>
        <li>Omega Notation(&Omega;-notation) - best case complexity</li>
        <li>Theta Notation(&Theta;-notation) - average case complexity</li>
        </ol>
