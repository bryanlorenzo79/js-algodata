    <h3>Big-O Notation</h3>
    The worst case complexity of an algorithm is represented using the Big-O notation.<br>
    Big-O notation describes the complexity of an algorithm using algebraic terms.<br><br>
    It has two important characteristics:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>It is expressed in terms of input.</li>
      <li>It focuses on the bigger picture without getting caught in the minute details</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Big-O Time Complexity</h3>
      <code>
        <pre>
      function summation(n) {
        let sum = 0;
        for(let i = 1; i = n; i++) {
           sum += 1;
        }
        return sum;
      }
        </pre>
        </code>
      It focuses on the bigger picture without getting caught up in the minute details.<br>
      Time complexity is linear. The greater the number of calculation the greater the<br>
      time increases.

      <h3>Few points to note</h3>
      Multiple algorithms exist for the same problem and there is no one right solution.<br>
      Different algorithms work well under different constraints.<br>
      The same algorithm with the same programming language can be implemented in different<br>
      ways.<br>
      When writing programs at work, don't lose sight of the big picture. Rather than<br>
      writing clever code, write code that is simple to read and maintain.<br>
